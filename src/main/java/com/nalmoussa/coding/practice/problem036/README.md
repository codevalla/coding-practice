# Few Notes:

* I assumed the file doesn't have invalid lines (empty lines for example)
* I assumed each line has a word followed by numbers. Namely, I assumed we don't have things like the following: `square four`
* Although, I didn't put unit tests here, but I made sure the code is modularized enough, so it can easily tested
* I assumed we don't have to worry about double overflow, but it's something that can easily managed if needed.
* I assumed the requirement is to print the output and not to store it back in a text file.
